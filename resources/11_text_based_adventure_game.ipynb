    "# Create Your Own Text-Based Adventure Game\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've learned about basic data types, loops, and conditionals, your coding challenge is to create a simple text-based adventure game. This game will prompt the player with descriptions of scenarios and ask them to make choices that affect the outcome of the game."

    "## Some Suggestions to Get Started\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Set the Scene**: Start by describing the initial setting of the game using print statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Get Player Input**: Use the `input()` function to ask the player what they want to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Process Player Choices**: Use conditionals (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to move the story forward based on the player's choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Create Variables for Player Stats**: Use variables to keep track of the player's attributes, like health, items, or any other relevant stats.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Include Loops**: Use loops to handle repetitive actions or to create sections of the game that the player can explore until they make a certain choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Consequences of Choices**: Use variables and conditionals to reflect changes in the player's stats based on their choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Endings**: Create different endings based on the choices the player makes throughout the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "These suggestions are just a starting point. Remember, the goal is to practice the concepts you've learned, so a small text-based adventure game with a few choices will suffice. Keep in mind that a game can quickly become complex with too many layers of choices, so it's perfectly fine to start simple and build from there."
